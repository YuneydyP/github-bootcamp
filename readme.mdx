# Git vs Github
Whereas Git is the tool which does bulk of the work, Github is the online interface that helps you
visualize all the operations you are performing and even perform them for you in some cases. It also
stores the repository online so your work is no longer just local to your computer hard drive

## What is Git?
 
Git is a CLI (command line interface) program used primarily within a terminal. i.e.
 
- Mac/Linux built in terminal
 
- Windows options via [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/)
 
You might've heard of commands such as `ls`, `echo`, or `pwd` that list your current directory, it's contents, and such

**Usage Examples**
```
git checkout <branch name>
git add <file>
git commit -m "<commit message>"
```
Format is usually `<program name> <command> <options>`
 
In this case, `git add <file>`
